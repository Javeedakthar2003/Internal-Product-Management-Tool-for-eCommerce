Interview Design Task – Internal Product Management Tool Link : https://internal-product-management-tool-for-e-commerce-r192-96xbjaenk.vercel.app/


Context
We are building an internal tool to manage the product catalog of an eCommerce platform.
The platform currently sells dresses and shoes.
Every 6 months, it plans to expand into new categories (e.g., watches, smartphones, grooming products, accessories).
Each category has its own unique attributes. For example:
Smartphones → OS, RAM, Battery Size
Watches → Dial Color, Dial Size, Strap Type
The tool should enable internal users (merchandisers, category managers) to:
Define new product categories and their specific attributes
Create, update, and manage products with category-specific attributes
Ensure data integrity and support scalability for future category expansion
Task Expectations
You will approach this assignment in three structured steps:
Step 1: Database Design
Design a scalable, relational database schema that supports:
Dynamic product categories
Custom attributes per category
Product creation and updates
Deliverables:
ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) with entities, attributes, data types, and relationships
A short justification of your design decisions (e.g., normalization, flexibility, future-proofing)
Step 2: Class Design
Based on the database schema, create a class diagram for the tool.
Clearly highlight:
Class relationships
Key methods and responsibilities
Deliverables:
Class diagram with appropriate detail
Step 3: Implementation
Implement the internal tool using a tech stack of your choice.
The tool should allow managing:
Categories
Attributes
Products
Deliverables:
Working code hosted on GitHub
Evaluation Criteria
We are not measuring speed. Quality matters more than how fast you finish.
We will evaluate based on:
Database Design: scalability, normalization, flexibility
Class Design: clarity, maintainability, extensibility
Implementation: code quality, structure, documentation, usability
Completeness: following instructions, delivering all required artifacts
